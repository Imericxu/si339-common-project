          He loves the beach and playing fetch. He is 4 years old and still acts
          like a puppy at times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bob’s favorite food is steak. He likes medium rare. He will do tricks
          for it, which includes rolling over. He also likes to chase squirrels
          up trees and go for runs with his owner. Bob does not like cats and
          his best friend is a Pitbull names john.

        <h2>Finn</h2>

        <img
          src="images/pets/finn-halloween.jpg"
          alt="Finn wears a bat costume for halloween."
        />

        <p>
          Finn is a 7 year old grey cat. I feel like no one really knows cat
          breeds so I’m just gonna go with grey. He loves doing tricks for
          treats and his favorite is giving high fives to people. He might as
          well be a dog as he loves the outdoors and meeting new people. I can
          only describe him as goofy and chaotic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finn’s biggest enemy is his vet. I don’t know whether or not it’s
          because his vet is an MSU alum, but he doesn’t like him. He actually
          has to be prescribed a sedative before he goes to the vet office
          because he’ll suddenly act like he was never a house cat for 7 years.
        </p>

        <p>
          Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and
          playful dogs. Biscuit enjoys running outside in circles and then
          laying down in the grass in the sun for hours. He also likes going for
          occasional swims.
        </p>
        <p>
          As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep
          in his dog bed and watch Netflix with his owners. His favorite treat
          is apples.

        <h2>Honey</h2>

        <img
          src="images/pets/honey-main.jpeg"
          alt="Honey is a medium-sized golden retriever with honey brown fur. She has a white patch of fur on her chest and her right eye is smaller than her left."
        />

        <p>
          Honey’s favorite thing in the world is swimming. Even if it is the
          middle of January and half of the lake is frozen, Honey will be in the
          water. She is a smart swimmer, so when my brother and I go underwater,
          she will follow our air bubbles and be waiting for us when we come up
          for air.
        </p>
        <p>
          While most dogs like to chase balls or sticks, Honey likes to chase
          rocks. She will even chase rocks into the water and stick her whole
          face in the water to try and find the rock thrown. Chasing rocks is
          her main form of exercise right now as she refuses to go on walks from
          our house. If we drive her to another spot and walk from there, Honey
          will go on a walk but she refuses to leave our driveway when we try to
          walk from home. Finally one other Honey-ism is that her safe place is
          bathtubs. Many times our family has woken up in the middle of the
          night and found Honey is a bathtub.
        </p>

        <h2>Milktea</h2>

        <img src="images/pets/milktea-main.jpg" alt="Milktea taking nap" />

        <p>
          Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves
          her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She
          makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a
          loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it
          probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been
          empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic
          disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against
          keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they
          reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints
          and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is
          living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty
          while sacrificing the animals’ health.
