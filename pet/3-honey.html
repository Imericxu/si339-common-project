      />

      <p>
        Honeyâ€™s favorite thing in the world is swimming. Even if it is the
        middle of January and half of the lake is frozen, Honey will be in the
        water. She is a smart swimmer, so when my brother and I go underwater,
        she will follow our air bubbles and be waiting for us when we come up
        for air.
      </p>
      <p>
        While most dogs like to chase balls or sticks, Honey likes to chase
        rocks. She will even chase rocks into the water and stick her whole face
        in the water to try and find the rock thrown. Chasing rocks is her main
        form of exercise right now as she refuses to go on walks from our house.
        If we drive her to another spot and walk from there, Honey will go on a
        walk but she refuses to leave our driveway when we try to walk from
        home. Finally one other Honey-ism is that her safe place is bathtubs.
        Many times our family has woken up in the middle of the night and found
        Honey is a bathtub.
